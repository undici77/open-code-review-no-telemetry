# Coding agent plugins

Open Code Review ships platform-specific integrations for Claude Code, Codex,
Cursor, Kimi Code, and QCA Forward. Choose your platform below instead of
adapting installation instructions written for a different agent.

All integrations require Git 2.41 or later. Install the `ocr` CLI first:

```bash
npm install -g @alibaba-group/open-code-review
```

Configure and test an OCR LLM before running a review, unless you plan to use
[Delegation Mode](https://open-codereview.ai/docs/delegate):

```bash
ocr config provider
ocr config model
ocr llm test
```

## Claude Code

Run these commands inside Claude Code:

```text
/plugin marketplace add alibaba/open-code-review
/plugin install open-code-review@open-code-review
```

This installs the `/open-code-review:review` and
`/open-code-review:delegate-review` slash commands. See the
[Claude Code guide](https://open-codereview.ai/docs/claude-code) for manual
installation, usage, and behavior.

## Codex

Add this repository as a Codex marketplace, then start Codex:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add alibaba/open-code-review
codex
```

Open `/plugins`, install and enable **Open Code Review**, then start a new task.
The plugin exposes callable review skills backed by the local `ocr` CLI. For
example:

```text
@Open Code Review review my current changes
@Open Code Review review this branch against main
@Open Code Review review and fix high-confidence issues
```

## Cursor

This repository includes a Cursor plugin manifest at
[`.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`](.cursor-plugin/plugin.json). For a local manual
installation, copy the entire `plugins/open-code-review/` directory to:

```text
~/.cursor/plugins/local/open-code-review/
```

Verify that the manifest is located at
`~/.cursor/plugins/local/open-code-review/.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`, then
restart Cursor or run **Developer: Reload Window**. The plugin provides the
portable OCR review skills from the bundled `skills/` directory.

See the [Cursor plugin documentation](https://cursor.com/docs/plugins) for
plugin loading and management details.

## Kimi Code

This repository is itself a Kimi Code plugin. The manifest lives at the
repository root ([`.kimi-plugin/plugin.json`](../../.kimi-plugin/plugin.json))
because Kimi Code treats the repository root as the plugin root when installing
from GitHub; its `skills` and `commands` paths point down into this directory.

Run this inside Kimi Code:

```text
/plugins install https://github.com/alibaba/open-code-review
```

Then run `/reload` (or start a new session) to activate the plugin. It
provides the `/open-code-review:review` and `/open-code-review:delegate-review`
slash commands plus the portable OCR review skills, backed by the local `ocr`
CLI.

Plugins are installed per-user and apply to every project. Manage the
installation with `/plugins list`, `/plugins info open-code-review`,
`/plugins disable open-code-review`, and `/plugins remove open-code-review`.
See the
[Kimi Code plugin documentation](https://www.kimi.com/code/docs/en/kimi-code-cli/customization/plugins.html)
for details.

## QCA Forward

QCA Forward uses the host model through OCR delegation mode. Publish the
`open-code-review-delegate` Skill, preinstall OCR in the referenced QCA
environment, and create a Forward Template from the bundled example. No OCR
LLM endpoint is required.

See the [QCA Forward integration guide](qca/README.md) and
[template example](qca/template.example.json).
