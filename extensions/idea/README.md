# Open Code Review (IntelliJ IDEA Plugin)

An IntelliJ IDEA plugin built on the [`open-code-review`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@alibaba-group/open-code-review) (`ocr`) CLI. It hosts the VS Code extension's Preact webview inside a JCEF browser and brings AI code review into the editor: start reviews from the tool window, stream logs live, and apply / dismiss / flag-as-false-positive each comment inline — kept in sync with the tool window both ways.

---

## Features

- **Three review modes**: workspace changes, branch comparison (`--from` / `--to`), and a single commit (`--commit`).
- **Files-to-review preview**: lists changed files from the current Git state; click a file to view its changes in the native diff view.
- **Custom review prompt**: optionally append a `--background` hint for the current review.
- **Streaming logs**: tail the CLI output live during review, cancel anytime.
- **Results + two-way sync**: on completion, comment cards appear in the tool window while inline comment panels render in the editor; apply / dismiss / false-positive actions stay in sync on both sides.
- **Empty / cancelled / failed states**: dedicated views for no issues, user cancellation, and CLI failure (failures are retryable and surface the real error returned by the CLI).
- **Configuration management**: view / edit the LLM provider config inside the plugin (persisted via `ocr config set`).
- **Model switching / connectivity test**: switch models and test connectivity to the LLM from the config panel.

---

## Prerequisites

1. Install the `ocr` CLI globally:

   ```bash
   npm i -g @alibaba-group/open-code-review
   ```

2. Configure a working LLM (endpoint, API key, model). Configure it via the CLI directly, or in the plugin's config panel:

   ```bash
   ocr config set llm.url https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages
   ocr config set llm.auth_token sk-...
   ocr config set llm.model claude-opus-4-6
   ocr config set llm.use_anthropic true
   ```

   The config is written to `~/.opencodereview/config.json`.

---

## Development

### Environment

- JDK 21 (used by Gradle to run the build). The Gradle wrapper is included, so no separate Gradle install is required.
- Node.js + npm — build-time only, to bundle the webview. Not required at runtime.
- A globally available `ocr` CLI and `git` (see "Prerequisites") — the plugin is essentially a GUI front-end for `ocr`.

### Start the dev environment

```bash
cd extensions/idea
./gradlew runIde      # launch a sandbox IDE with the plugin installed
```

Open a project with Git changes in the sandbox IDE — you'll see the Open Code Review icon in the
tool window strip and can start a review.

> After editing code: webview changes require **reopening the tool window** in the sandbox IDE;
> host-side (Kotlin) changes require **restarting `runIde`**.

### Scripts

```bash
./gradlew build          # compile Kotlin + npm install + npm run build (bundles the webview)
./gradlew test           # run unit tests
./gradlew runIde         # launch a sandbox IDE with the plugin
./gradlew buildPlugin    # produce a distributable .zip (see "Build a release package")
```

> No Node.js / npm on PATH? Skip the frontend build with `./gradlew <task> -PskipFrontend=true`
> (uses the previously bundled `src/main/resources/webview/` output).

### Debugging notes

- **Two-way messaging**: the webview and host communicate via `postMessage` through the JCEF bridge;
  message types live in `extensions/frontend/src/shared/messages.ts`. Both sides route through `dispatch`
  / `handle` — start there when debugging. The bridge transport is the only file that differs from the
  VS Code extension: `frontend/src/webview/bridge.idea.ts` (vs. `bridge.vsc.ts`). webpack selects the
  correct bridge via `NormalModuleReplacementPlugin` based on the `OCR_TARGET` environment variable.
- **CLI invocation**: all `ocr` sub-commands run via `ProcessBuilder` in
  `src/main/kotlin/com/alibaba/opencodereview/idea/services/CliService.kt`. A non-zero CLI exit code
  rejects with the `Error:` text from stderr, which helps diagnose "review failed / connection failed".
- **Config read/write**: `ConfigService.kt` reads `~/.opencodereview/config.json` and delegates writes
  to `ocr config set`. Webview fields are camelCase (e.g. `useAnthropic`) while the disk/CLI side is
  snake_case (e.g. `use_anthropic`); the conversion lives in `ConfigParse.kt`.

---

## Build

### Compile artifacts only

```bash
./gradlew build        # compiles Kotlin and bundles the webview into src/main/resources/webview/
```

Artifacts: the plugin jar (Kotlin host) + `src/main/resources/webview/{webview.js,configPanel.js}` (webview SPA).

### Build a release package (.zip)

```bash
./gradlew buildPlugin
```

This compiles the host, bundles the webview, and produces
`build/distributions/open-code-review-idea-<version>.zip` in the `extensions/idea` directory.

### Install / verify locally

In IntelliJ IDEA: `Settings → Plugins → ⚙️ → Install Plugin from Disk…` → pick the generated `.zip`.

> To use a locally installed IntelliJ IDEA instead of the downloaded platform, set `localIdePath`
> in `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` (not the repo's `gradle.properties`, which is machine-independent).
> The build falls back to the downloaded platform if the path is missing.

## Architecture

It uses the same **Monolithic WebView + Thin Host** design as the VS Code extension:

- The **WebView** is a separately built Preact SPA, shared with the VS Code extension at
  `extensions/frontend/`. The only IDEA-specific file is `bridge.idea.ts`; webpack selects the
  correct bridge (`bridge.idea.ts` vs. `bridge.vsc.ts`) via `NormalModuleReplacementPlugin` based on
  the `OCR_TARGET` environment variable.
- The **Host** layer (Kotlin / IntelliJ) is thin, handling only CLI invocation, the file system, Git
  operations, and editor comments. It hosts the webview inside JCEF.
- The two communicate via `postMessage` through a JCEF bridge, with shared TypeScript types in
  `extensions/frontend/src/shared/` for type safety.

```
extensions/
├── frontend/                shared frontend (webview SPA + shared types)
│   ├── src/shared/          shared types & postMessage protocol
│   └── src/webview/         WebView SPA (Preact): views / components / store / bridge
└── idea/
    ├── src/main/kotlin/     Host (Kotlin / IntelliJ): services / providers / jcef / messages
    └── src/main/resources/  plugin.xml / icons / bundled webview output
```

---

## Compatibility

- `com.intellij.modules.jcef` is declared as an **optional** dependency, so the plugin loads on both
  2025.1 (JCEF in the core) and 2026.2 (JCEF as a separate bundled plugin).
- The webview's `--vscode-*` CSS variables are injected from the current IntelliJ theme, so the UI
  follows Darcula / Light automatically.
