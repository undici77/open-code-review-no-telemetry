# full 40-hex commit SHA with a trailing "# vX.Y.Z" version comment. A
# floating tag inside action.yml silently undermines consumers who SHA-pin
# alibaba/open-code-review itself: the outer pin freezes this repository,
# but a moved inner tag still changes what actually runs (see issue #816).
# Workflows are held to the same rule because several carry credentials —
# release.yml alone holds the npm token and the attestation id-token, so a
# moved upstream tag there has credential blast radius (see issue #841).

# The whole line must be a pinned reference: only list/indent syntax before
# `uses:`, a 40-hex SHA, and a strict `# vX.Y.Z` comment with nothing after
# it. Without the anchors a floating tag would be accepted whenever a
# pinned-looking fragment appeared anywhere in the line (e.g. inside a
# trailing comment), and a `# v7` comment would satisfy the format the
# check claims to enforce. Anything unusual (quoted values, extra trailing
# content) fails closed rather than being guessed at.
# The directive filter also matches flow-mapping openers ("- {uses: …}")
# and quoted keys ("uses":, 'uses' :) — valid YAML the pinned pattern below
# never accepts — so those forms fail closed as unusual syntax instead of
# slipping past the filter and being silently skipped.
