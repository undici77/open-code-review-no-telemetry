`ocr viewer` is a small embedded HTTP server that renders past review
sessions in a browser-friendly UI. No external dependencies — sessions
are read directly from the JSONL files OCR writes to disk during every
review.

## Launching

```bash
ocr viewer                       # start and open the browser
ocr viewer --addr :3000          # bind to all interfaces on port 3000
ocr viewer --addr 0.0.0.0:8080   # bind on all interfaces
ocr viewer --open=never          # just print the URL
ocr viewer --open=always         # force it when auto declines (piped output, WSL)
```

The default address is `localhost:5483`. The server holds the foreground
— `Ctrl+C` stops it. Sessions are scanned lazily from
`~/.opencodereview/sessions/` on each request, so a review running in
another terminal shows up the moment its JSONL file appears.

> **DNS-rebinding protection.** The viewer checks the `Host` header
> against a loopback allowlist (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `::1`). A
> concrete bind host (e.g. `--addr 192.168.1.10:5483`) is added
> automatically, but **wildcard** binds (`:3000`, `0.0.0.0`, `::`) are
> not — reaching the UI from a LAN IP or hostname then returns
> `forbidden host`. To expose a wildcard bind, set
> `OCR_VIEWER_ALLOWED_HOSTS` to a comma-separated list of allowed
> hostnames (e.g. `OCR_VIEWER_ALLOWED_HOSTS=box.local,192.168.1.10`).

## Opening the browser

`ocr viewer` opens the URL in your default browser as soon as the server is
listening. `--open` controls this and takes the same three values as the global
`--color`:

| Value | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `auto` (default) | Open only where it is likely to work — see below. |
| `always` | Open unconditionally. Use this where `auto` declines but a browser is in fact reachable — piped output, or WSL with no display. |
| `never` | Print the URL and do nothing else. |

In `auto` mode the browser is **not** opened when:

- stdout is not a terminal — output is piped or redirected;
- `SSH_CONNECTION` is set **and** no display is forwarded — a remote host with
  nothing to open into. `ssh -X` and `ssh -Y` set `DISPLAY`, so they are not
  suppressed;
- on Linux, `DISPLAY` and `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` are both empty — no display server.

The reason is appended to the ready line, so a deliberately suppressed
auto-open never looks like a broken one:

```
Viewer ready: http://localhost:5483 (browser not opened: no DISPLAY or WAYLAND_DISPLAY)
```

On Unix, `$BROWSER` is tried first: a colon-separated list of commands, each
either containing a `%s` placeholder for the URL or receiving it as a trailing
argument. Otherwise the platform default runs — `open` on macOS, `xdg-open` on
Linux and the BSDs, `rundll32` on Windows. Failing to open a browser is a
warning on stderr and never fatal; the server keeps serving either way.

## Four pages

The viewer has four URLs:

| URL | What you see |
|---|---|
| `/` | List of all repositories that have sessions on disk. |
| `/r/{repo}` | List of sessions for one repository, newest first. |
| `/r/{repo}/{sessionID}` | Full detail for a single session. |
| `/r/{repo}/compare` | Two sessions of one repository, compared. |

`{repo}` is a path-encoded string (separators `/` and `\` replaced with
`-`, colons replaced with `_` — the same encoding used to name the
on-disk directories). You don't usually type this — you click through.

### `/` — Repository list

For each repo with at least one session you see the repo path, the
total session count, the most recent activity timestamp, and a `Check`
link to its sessions. The search box filters the list by repo path, and
ten repositories fit on a page; the pager at the bottom right moves
between pages.

### `/r/{repo}` — Session list for one repo

For each session: ID (a UUID), branch name (when OCR was able to
detect it), review mode, model, file count, duration, and a started-at
timestamp, and a `Check` link to the next-older session. Ten sessions
fit on a page; the pager at the bottom right moves between pages.

### `/r/{repo}/{sessionID}` — Session detail

The detail page is the interesting one. It shows:

1. **Header** — diff range, model, branch, total tokens, run duration.
2. **File group** — one block per reviewed group. Files are grouped
   semantically before review, so a block may cover several related
   files; its title is the group's file paths. Inside each group, five
   "task type" lanes:

| Task type | When it appears |
|---|---|
| `plan_task` | The plan phase ran (largest file ≥ `PLAN_MODE_LINE_THRESHOLD`, or 2+ files totalling ≥ `PLAN_MODE_GROUP_LINE_THRESHOLD`). |
| `main_task` | Every group. The main review loop — one pass per review round. |
| `review_filter_task` | The post-review comment-filtering pass ran for this group. |
| `memory_compression_task` | The active+compress zone exceeded 60 % / 80 % budget. |
| `re_location_task` | A `code_comment` couldn't be anchored, fallback re-location ran. |

Each lane is a horizontal strip of **task cards** — one per LLM round
trip. Cards are coloured by task type so you can see at a glance which
phases dominated the run.

Longer lists on this page — **File breakdown**, **Files Reviewed**,
**Session Tasks**, and **Conversations** — show twenty items per page.
The pager stays hidden while a section still fits on one page.

### `/r/{repo}/compare` — Compare two sessions

The same four buckets `ocr session compare` prints, rendered as a page.
The session list's **Action** column carries a `Check` link: each row
opens a comparison against the next-older session, so the newest row
shows what changed since the run before it. The oldest row shows `-`,
having no older run to compare against.

Findings are sorted into four buckets:

| Bucket | Meaning |
|---|---|
| New | Only the later run reported it. |
| Persisting | Both runs reported it. |
| Resolved | Only the earlier run reported it, and the later run did review that file. |
| Not reviewed | Only the earlier run reported it, and the later run never looked at that file. Nobody re-checked it, so it is not resolved. |

One thing the page does differently: the CLI omits a bucket that came
out empty, the page always prints all four. `Resolved (0)` is an
answer, and a section that silently vanished would read as a broken
page.

Each bucket shows twenty findings per page; the pager stays hidden
when the bucket fits on one page.

A run old enough to predate run manifests recorded no coverage, so
every unmatched finding from it falls into Resolved rather than Not
reviewed.

To compare any other pair, edit the query string:
`/r/{repo}/compare?before=<older session id>&after=<newer session id>`.
Both ids must belong to the repository in the URL.

If the two runs used different review modes, the page shows the same
warning `ocr session compare` prints: they may not have looked at the
same files, so the buckets are not directly comparable.

## What's in a task card

Click a task card to expand. Each card has:

- a **header row** — request number, model badge, a token badge
  (`P:` prompt / `C:` completion, plus `CR:` / `CW:` cache read/write
  when present), a duration badge, and an error badge when the round
  failed;
- **Response** — the raw assistant response, including any reasoning /
  `thinking` blocks;
- **Tool calls** — each tool invocation with arguments + the result that
  was returned (collapsible).

The full message list sent to the model and the in-scope tool
definitions are **not** rendered in the card UI; if you need them,
inspect the JSONL transcript directly (the `messages` field on each
`llm_request` record).

## Review comments

Below the task lanes, the session page lists every finding the review
produced as **comment cards**, grouped by file, showing the comment
text, its existing/suggested code where present, and severity/category
badges. Chips on the filter bar narrow the list by severity or category.
Twenty comments fit on a page; the pager stays hidden when there is
only one. Changing a severity or category filter returns to page 1;
marking a finding, toggling **Hide marked**, or clearing marks keeps
the current page where it still exists.

### Marking findings as you fix them

Each card carries three buttons — **Fixed** / **Ignored** /
**Clear** — that set a per-comment mark:

- Marks are mutually exclusive: setting one replaces another, and
  **Clear** removes it. The current state shows as a colored chip on
  the card.
- **Hide marked** (on by default, remembered per browser) keeps marked
  cards out of the way while you work through what is left. The toolbar
  counts how many are marked and hidden; switch the toggle off any time
  to see everything again.
- **Clear all marks** resets the whole session at once.

Marks are viewer state, not review data — the viewer itself stays
read-only:

- They are stored in your browser's `localStorage`, scoped to the
  session page. Nothing is ever written next to the session JSONL, and
  the viewer exposes no write API at all.
- Marks belong to one session **and one browser**: another browser or
  machine sees the session unmarked, and clearing the browser's storage
  for the site starts it over.
- Re-running a review of the same change produces a new session, which
  starts unmarked.

## Use cases

The viewer is designed around three workflows:

### "Why did the model say that?"

Open a comment in your terminal output, locate the group containing the
file in the viewer, and walk down its `main_task` lane. The card whose **tool calls**
include the `code_comment` you care about is the round that produced
it. The card's Response shows the model's reasoning; for the exact
prompt + context the model was sent, open the `llm_request` record for
that request number in the JSONL transcript (its `messages` field).

### "Why was this file silent?"

A file with **no comments** is a successful review only if the model
*deliberately* called `task_done`. If the lane shows tool calls but no
`code_comment`, that's an intentional clean review. If the lane ends in
an error card, it's a failure dressed up as silence — surface it as a
warning.

### "What did compression keep / drop?"

The `memory_compression_task` lane shows every compression round.
Inside, the Response pane has the resulting summary; the rendered XML
of the compress zone that was fed in lives in the round's
`llm_request` `messages` in the JSONL transcript. Useful when debugging
a "the model forgot earlier context" complaint — you can see whether
compression dropped the relevant detail.

## Storage layout on disk

The viewer reads from:

```
~/.opencodereview/sessions/
└── <path-encoded-repo-path>/
    └── <session-id>.jsonl
```

Each line in the JSONL file is one event:

```json
{"type": "llm_request", "filePath": "src/foo.go", "taskType": "main_task", "request_no": 1, "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Review this diff…"}], "timestamp": "2026-06-02T10:15:23Z"}
{"type": "llm_response", "filePath": "src/foo.go", "taskType": "main_task", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6", "content": "Found 2 issues…", "duration_ms": 8421, "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 12450, "completion_tokens": 320}}
{"type": "tool_call", "filePath": "src/foo.go", "tool_name": "file_read", "arguments": "{\"file_path\":\"src/foo.go\",\"start_line\":1,\"end_line\":50}", "result": "File: src/foo.go (Total lines: 220)\nIS_TRUNCATED: false\nLINE_RANGE: 1-50\n1|package foo…", "ok": true, "duration_ms": 14}
```

`filePath` holds the **group key**: a single path for a one-file group,
or the group's paths sorted and comma-joined when several files were
reviewed together.

Lines are append-only — a partial JSONL means a session was killed
mid-run, and the viewer renders what it has.

To free disk space, delete entire session files; the viewer
regenerates its index on the next request.

## Privacy

The JSONL transcripts contain **everything** sent to and received from
the LLM, including any code that was in the diff. They live entirely on
your machine inside `~/.opencodereview/`. OCR does not upload them
anywhere.

If your reviews include code you wouldn't want stored long-term,
either:

- delete the session files periodically, or
- redirect `--audience agent --format json` output to a transient pipe
  in CI and run with a temporary `HOME` so the JSONL never persists.

The OpenTelemetry exporter is a separate concern — see
[Telemetry](../telemetry/) for how to keep prompt content out of
exported traces.

## When the viewer is not the right tool

- For programmatic post-processing (CI, dashboards), use
  `ocr review --format json --audience agent`. The viewer renders for
  humans, not machines.
- For grepping across many sessions, use `jq` on the JSONL files
  directly. There's no search box in the UI yet.
